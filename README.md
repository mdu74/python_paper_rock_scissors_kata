# Rock Paper Sciccors Kata

Rock Paper Scissors is a game involving two players making predefined hand gestures at each other. The gesture that
each player uses is played against the other, with a winner being decided based on the rules being used.

The three gestures used in base Rock Paper Scissors are... well... rock, paper, and scissors. The way these are scored
is as such: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock. It gets a lot more complicated when you
introduce new gestures, but let's keep it simple for now.

As always, we want you to create a backend for the game that we can use to hook up to our many game clients
we're going to be creating. Once again, feel free to use any front-end to test your program.

## Run Tests
To run the tests, open the command prompt or terminal where the test file is and type the following command:
